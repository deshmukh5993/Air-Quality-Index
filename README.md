# Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard 🌍

## 📌 Project Overview
This project involves building a **Power BI dashboard** to analyze air quality across different cities.  
The goal is to track pollution levels, identify the most/least polluted areas, and understand AQI trends.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Air_quality_index.pbix` → Power BI dashboard.  
- `README.md` → Project documentation.

## 🔍 Dashboard Insights
- **Average AQI values** for major pollutants (PM2.5, CO, NO, SO₂).  
- **Top 3 least polluted & most polluted cities**.  
- **Trend analysis** of AQI over time.  
- **Geo-map visualization** of AQI area-wise.  

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** (interactive dashboard).  
- **Environmental AQI dataset**.  

## 🚀 Results
- Provided actionable insights into pollution levels.  
- Identified cities requiring urgent pollution control.  
- Built easy-to-understand visuals for policymakers.
